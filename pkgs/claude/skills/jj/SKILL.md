description: How to work with Jujutsu (jj) version control non-interactively, and the user's stacked-MR workflow (`jj upload` → one MR/PR per change, on GitLab or GitHub). Use whenever the repo has a `.jj` directory (`jj root` succeeds), or the task involves jj, commits/changes in a jj repo, stacking, rebasing, squashing, splitting, describing, reordering or dropping changes, pushing, bookmarks, merge requests, or addressing review feedback. In a jj repo this overrides the git-based commit/stack/mr skills.

# Jujutsu (jj)

jj 0.45, Git backend, remote on GitLab or GitHub (`jj upload` picks the forge from the remote host, or `upload.forge`). Config: `~/.config/jj/config.toml`.

**Is this a jj repo?** `jj root` succeeds or `.jj/` exists → use `jj` for **every write** (commit, rebase, branch, push). A `.git/` next to it ("colocated") is fine for read-only git tools, but never `git commit/checkout/rebase/reset/stash/push` there. git sees a detached HEAD and that is normal.

## Mental model (differs from git)

- **The working copy is a commit: `@`.** Every jj command first snapshots files on disk into `@`. There is no staging area, no `git add`, no stash. Untracked files are tracked automatically unless gitignored.
- **Change ID vs commit ID.** Change IDs (letters k–z, e.g. `qkuklztw`) stay the same when a change is rewritten. Commit IDs (hex) change on every rewrite. **Always refer to changes by change ID.**
- **Rewriting is normal and cheap.** Rewriting a change rebases its descendants automatically. Bookmarks follow the rewritten commits.
- **Conflicts don't block.** A rebase that conflicts still succeeds, and the conflict is recorded in the commit (`(conflict)` in the log). Fix it later.
- **Everything is undoable.** `jj undo` reverts the last operation. `jj op log` lists operations, and `jj op restore <op-id>` jumps back to any one of them.
- **Immutable commits** (trunk and anything pushed to it) can't be rewritten. Never pass `--ignore-immutable` unless the user explicitly asks.
- **Bookmarks = git branches.** They do not move when you create new commits. `jj upload` manages them for this user (see below).

## Never open an editor or TUI (you have no terminal)

These hang or fail without a TTY, so always use the non-interactive form:

| Don't | Do |
|---|---|
| `jj describe` | `jj describe -m "msg"` (or `-r <rev> -m`) |
| `jj commit` | `jj commit -m "msg"` |
| `jj squash` when both sides have descriptions (opens editor) | `jj squash ... -u` (keep destination message) or `-m "msg"` |
| `jj split` with no paths (opens diff editor) | `jj split -r <rev> -m "msg for first part" <paths...>` — the named paths go to the first commit, the rest to the second |
| `-i` / `--interactive` / `--tool`, `jj resolve` (merge tool), `jj diffedit` | edit files directly, then a normal command |

Multi-line message: `jj describe -m "$(printf 'feat: title\n\nBody line')"`, or pipe it: `printf '...' | jj describe --stdin`.

## Everyday commands

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Status / what's in `@` | `jj st` |
| History of current stack | `jj stack` (alias: `trunk() \| trunk()..(@::)`) or `jj log -r '<revset>'` |
| Diff | `jj diff` (of `@`), `jj diff -r <rev> --git`, `jj diff --stat`, `jj show <rev>` |
| Finish current change, start a new one on top | `jj commit -m "msg"` (= describe + new) |
| Name the current change | `jj describe -m "msg"` |
| New empty change on top of X | `jj new X -m "msg"` |
| Insert a new change after / before X | `jj new -A X -m "msg"` / `jj new -B X -m "msg"` |
| Work directly inside an existing change | `jj edit X` (later changes are rebased automatically as you edit) |
| Move all of `@` into its parent | `jj squash` |
| Move part / all of one change into another | `jj squash --from A --into B [paths...] -u` |
| Auto-distribute `@`'s hunks into the stack changes that last touched those lines | `jj absorb` |
| Drop a change (descendants rebase onto its parent) | `jj abandon X` |
| Discard edits to a file in `@` | `jj restore <paths>` (from parent) / `jj restore --from X <paths>` |
| Move a single change | `jj rebase -r X -A Y` (after Y) / `-B Y` (before) / `-o Y` (onto, as a new branch) |
| Move a change with its descendants | `jj rebase -s X -o Y` |
| Move whole stack onto latest trunk | `jj rebase -b @ -o 'trunk()'` (or `jj sync`) |
| Fetch | `jj git fetch` |
| Undo last operation | `jj undo` |
| How did this change evolve? | `jj evolog -r X` |

Example: reorder the stack `A → B → C` into `A → C → B` with `jj rebase -r C -A A`.

### Revsets you'll use

`@` current · `@-` parent · `X::` X and descendants · `::X` X and ancestors · `X..Y` ancestors of Y not reachable from X · `trunk()` main branch head · `trunk()..@` your stack below @ · `stack()` the whole stack around @ · `mine()` · `conflicts()` · `empty()` · `description(substring:"fix")` · `bookmarks()` · combine with `|` `&` `~`.

### Machine-readable output

Use `--no-graph -T <template>` instead of parsing the default output:

```
jj log --no-graph -r 'trunk()..@' -T 'change_id.short(8) ++ " " ++ description.first_line() ++ " " ++ bookmarks ++ "\n"'
```

Useful template fields: `change_id`, `commit_id`, `description`, `bookmarks`, `local_bookmarks`, `parents.map(|p| p.change_id().short()).join(",")` (`parents` is a list, so it can't be printed directly), `empty`, `conflict`, `immutable`, `author.email()`.

## Conflicts

1. `jj log -r 'conflicts()'` shows conflicted changes, and `jj resolve --list -r X` shows their files.
2. `jj new X` (or `jj edit X`), then edit the files and remove the markers. jj's markers look like this:
   ```
   <<<<<<< conflict 1 of 1
   %%%%%%% diff from: zsqksuup 51719f56 "feat: F" (parents of rebased revision)
   \\\\\\\        to: pqomlopu 904c1e54 "feat: P" (rebase destination)
   -old line
   +side 1 line
   +++++++ yorpmywr 4acfd397 "feat: Q" (rebased revision)
   side 2 content
   >>>>>>> conflict 1 of 1 ends
   ```
   The labels after the markers vary (commit IDs and descriptions). The `%%%%%%%` section (with its `\\\\\\\ to:` header line) is a **diff** to apply to the `+++++++` side, not literal content. Write the final merged text and delete all marker lines.
3. If you used `jj new X`: `jj squash` folds the resolution into X. `jj st` should no longer list conflicts.

## The user's stacked-MR workflow

**One change = one merge request.** The commit's first line becomes the MR title and its body becomes the MR description. Each MR targets the branch of the change below it, and the bottom MR targets trunk.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `jj upload -n` | dry run: prints the plan (bookmark → target, title) and changes nothing |
| `jj upload` | uploads the whole stack around `@`: sets bookmarks, force-pushes, creates/updates MRs, retargets after reordering, closes MRs and deletes branches of abandoned or squashed-away changes |
| `jj upload -r '<revset>'` | uploads only those changes (the ones below them must be in trunk or already uploaded) |
| `jj upload --draft` | new MRs open as Draft |
| `jj sync` | fetch, rebase the stack onto trunk, drop changes that became empty (merged) |

Script: `~/.config/jj/scripts/jj-upload.py`. It is configured under `[upload]` in the jj config.

Rules:
- **The commit message is the source of truth.** Change MR titles or descriptions with `jj describe -r X -m ...` followed by `jj upload`. Never edit them in the forge UI or via glab/gh, because the next upload overwrites them.
- **Bookmarks starting with `nm/` are managed** (`nm/<slug>-<change-id>`). Don't create, rename, move or delete them by hand. To drop an MR, `jj abandon` the change; the next `jj upload` closes it.
- **Every change needs a description before upload.** Use Conventional Commits (`feat: …`, `fix: …`). Each change should compile and pass tests on its own.
- **Addressing review feedback on change X:**
  - Edit in place: `jj edit X`, change the files, `jj new <top-of-stack>` to go back.
  - Or fix on top: make the fix in `@`, then `jj squash --into X <paths> -u`, or let `jj absorb` route it.
  - Then (only if asked) `jj upload`.
- **After the bottom MR is merged:** run `jj sync`, then `jj upload` to retarget the rest of the stack.
- **Don't push or upload on your own.** `jj upload`, `jj git push` and anything that touches the forge (GitLab/GitHub) is outward-facing. Do it only when the user explicitly asks (in coordinator mode: the coordinator does it, not subagents). `jj git fetch` and `jj upload -n` are safe.

## Isolated agents (jj workspaces)

Agents with `isolation: worktree` (e.g. `coder`) run in their own jj workspace at `<repo>.agents/agent-<id>`. Its `@` is a new change on top of the change the caller was on. When the agent stops, a hook (`~/.claude/hooks/jj-workspace.py`) squashes its work into that change.

- **If you are such an agent:** just edit files. Don't run `jj` commands that move `@` (`jj new`, `jj edit`, `jj commit`). If you do, the work can't be squashed automatically and stays in your workspace.
- **If you are the coordinator:** switch to the change you want filled (`jj new` or `jj edit`) *before* spawning the agent. The squash result arrives as a system message. On a conflict, resolve it in the named change. On an "integration problem", the work is still in the agent's workspace.
- **Housekeeping:** `jj workspace list` shows agent workspaces. Idle ones are deleted after a day.

## Finishing a task in a jj repo

- Leave every change you made described. If you were working in `@`, either `jj commit -m ...` or `jj describe -m ...`.
- Report the change IDs and titles you created or rewrote (from `jj stack`), and say whether any change has a conflict.
- If something went wrong, `jj op log` + `jj undo` / `jj op restore` before attempting manual repair.
