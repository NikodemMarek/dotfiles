"""Knowledge blocks: the fenced sections an agent puts in its last message to submit what it learned (S12).

    ```

The fence closes at the first line that is only the same number of backticks, so a body with a fenced example (normal
triple backticks) goes in a block fenced with four (a ````knowledge ... ```` block). Either fence may be indented by up to
three spaces or tabs (a block in a list item); the lines of the block are dedented by the indent of the opening fence.
